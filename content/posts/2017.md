Today is the last day of 2017 and I took some time
to reflect on the last year.<br>
2017 kicked off with a new employer and a new project!

I joined <a class="imagelink" href="http://team4talent.be"><img src="/img/logos/team4talent.svg" alt="Team 4 Talent logo" style="width: 150px;"/></a> for a project at <a class="imagelink" href="https://www.infrabel.be/en"><img src="/img/logos/infrabel.png" alt="Infrabel logo" style="width: 125px;"/></a>.

After developing mostly in `.Net` it was
a fresh change to start working on...

It soon turned out to be a big challenge, I got introduced to

* [Web API 2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn448365(v=vs.118).aspx)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Mediatr](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)
* [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) / [store] (https://github.com/ngrx/store)
* [primeng](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/)
* Worked with [Oracle PL/SQL](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/plsql/index.html) for the 1st time!
* Learned working with Git _([cheatsheets](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) ftw)_,
strangely I only used TFS before... :smile:

By the end of september the contract at Infrabel ended.
I quickly joined the awesome team at [Proximus](https://www.proximus.be) to lend a hand
with developing a future proof platform for their Proximus TV customer app! Returning to more `.Net`!

Last year my interest in **WWII** grew exponentially!<br>
I watched [World At War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071075/), [Dunkirk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/), [WWII In Colour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2069688/), read **(!)** [I Escaped From Auschwitz](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/775198.I_Escaped_from_Auschwitz).<br>
We visited the Ardennes (Bastogne, ..) and Strassbourg (Maginot line, ..).

I picked up 3 new hobbies last year:

* FPV Drone racing! ([profile](https://rotorbuilds.com/profile/4373/))
{{< youtube xuA_3mWBfUw >}}
_(not my footage lol)_

* Vinyl ([profile](https://www.discogs.com/user/quadrostanology/collection))
* Blogging :sunglasses:

In september my 6y old daughter said goodbye to pre-school and started learning to read/write and do math! _(which she does an awesome job at!)_

I wish you all a very good EOY!!!
